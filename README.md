AtliQ Grands is experiencing a significant revenue challenge, with total revenue reported at ₹1.7 billion and a Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) of ₹7.35k. The occupancy rate stands at 57.87%, indicating that a substantial number of rooms remain unoccupied, which could be contributing to lost revenue opportunities. The Average Daily Rate (ADR) is ₹12.70k, suggesting that while room rates are high, the realization percentage of 70.15% indicates that there is room for improvement in converting bookings into actual revenue.

Insights reveal that the luxury category generates significantly higher revenue compared to the business category, highlighting a potential area for strategic focus. Mumbai emerges as the highest revenue-generating city with superior performance metrics, including the highest revenue per room available. Both weekdays and weekends show the same realization percentage, suggesting consistent pricing strategies may be effective.

The data also indicates that there is an opportunity to enhance performance by addressing the high cancellation rate, which has negatively impacted revenue. By leveraging these insights, AtliQ Grands can develop targeted strategies to improve occupancy rates, optimize pricing, and enhance customer retention, ultimately aiming to reclaim their market share in the competitive hospitality landscape.
